## Statement on University Academic and Support Systems

**Students and Disability Accommodations:**

USC welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University's educational programs. [[The Office of Student Accessibility Services]{.underline}](https://osas.usc.edu/) (OSAS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter disability-related barriers. Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at [[osas.usc.edu]{.underline}](http://osas.usc.edu/). You may contact OSAS at (213) 740-0776 or via email at <osasfrontdesk@usc.edu>.

**Student Financial Aid and Satisfactory Academic Progress:**

To be eligible for certain kinds of financial aid, students are required to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward their degree objectives. Visit the [[Financial Aid Office webpage]{.underline}](https://financialaid.usc.edu/) for [[undergraduate]{.underline}](https://financialaid.usc.edu/help-contact/)- and [[graduate-level]{.underline}](https://financialaid.usc.edu/graduate-professional-financial-aid/admitted-and-continuing-students/eligibility/) SAP eligibility requirements and the appeals process.
