## Thought Experiment {.unnumbered}

You have a group of 20 friends. You found out 10 have taken a "smart pill," and the others have not. When comparing the stat exam performance of the two groups, the "smart pill" group, on average, is better, with 90% CI [1.0, 5.0].

> Do you think the "smart pill" causes half of your friends to do better in stat?

## Thought Experiment (cont'd) {.unnumbered}

A researcher conducts an experiment with 20 students. Ten are randomly assigned to take a "smart pill," and the other a placebo. When comparing the stat exam performance of the two groups, the "smart pill" group, on average, is better, with 90% CI [1, 5].

> Do you think the "smart pill" causes half of the students to do better in stat?

Is there any difference in the **statistical results** between the two scenarios?

Is there any difference in **causal implications** between the two scenarios?

## Thought Experiment (cont'd) {.unnumbered}

A researcher conducts a study with 20 students. Ten volunteers took a "smart pill," and then the researcher compared their stat exam performance with 10 other students who had similar stat background as the "smart pill" group but did not take the pill. The "smart pill" group, on average, is better, with 90% CI [1, 5].

> Do you think the "smart pill" causes the first 10 students to do better in stat?

## Causal Inference

Obtaining an estimate of the causal effect of one variable on another

. . .

> an hour more exercise per day causes an increase in happiness by 0.1 to 0.2 points

. . .

- Intervention: if I exercise one hour more, my happiness will increase by 0.1 to 0.2 points
- Counterfactual: had I exercised one less hour, my happiness would have been 0.1 to 0.2 points less

## Potential Outcomes

$T$ is the binary treatment variable (e.g., new drug for boosting stat knowledge)

---

```{r}
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
po_dat <- data.frame(
    person = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8),
    attitude = c(4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 6, 8, 2),
    treat = c(75, 80, 70, 90, 85, 82, 95, 78),
    control = c(70, 88, 75, 92, 82, 85, 90, 78)
)
po_dat$te <- po_dat$treat - po_dat$control
po_ave <- c("Average", colMeans(po_dat[-1]))
knitr::kable(rbind(po_dat, po_ave),
    col.names = c("Person", "Math Attitude", "Y (if T = 1)", "Y (if T = 0)", "Y(1) - Y(0)"))
```

## Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

$$
\text{ATE} = \bar Y(1) - \bar Y(0)
$$

## Observed Outcomes

Only one potential outcome is observed for each person

. . .

E.g., Persons 2, 4, 6, 7 take the drug

```{r}
po_dat2 <- po_dat
po_dat2$control[c(2, 4, 6, 7)] <- NA
po_dat2$treat[c(1, 3, 5, 8)] <- NA
po_dat2$tx <- c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0)
po_dat2 <- po_dat2[c(1, 6, 2, 3, 4)]
po_ave2 <- c("average", "",
             colMeans(po_dat2, na.rm = TRUE)[-(1:2)])
knitr::kable(rbind(po_dat2, po_ave2),
    col.names = c("Person", "T", "Math Attitude", "Y (if T = 1)", "Y (if T = 0)"))
```

Why is the mean difference between the observed outcomes of the two groups so different from the true ATE?

## Directed Acyclic Graph

Allows researchers to encode **causal assumptions** of the data

- Based on knowledge of the *data* and the *variables*

## Basic Types of Junctions

**Fork**: A &larr; B &rarr; C

**Chain/Pipe**: A &rarr; B &rarr; C

**Collider**: A &rarr; B &larr; C

---

## Fork

aka Classic confounding

- *Confound*: something that misleads us about a causal influence

M &larr; <span style="color:red">A</span> &rarr; D

. . .

Assuming the DAG is correct,

- the *causal effect* of M &rarr; D can be obtained by holding constant A
    * stratifying by A; "controlling" for A

## Pedicting an Intervention

> What would happen to the divorce rate if we encourage more people to get married, so that marriage rate increases by 1 per 10 adults?

. . .

Based on our DAG, this should not change the median marriage age

## Back-Door Criterion

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: .618
dag4 <- dagitty("dag{
  X -> Y; W1 -> X; U -> W2; W2 -> X; W1 -> Y; U -> Y
}")
coordinates(dag4) <- list(x = c(X = 0, W1 = 0.66, U = 1.32, W2 = 0.66, Y = 2),
                          y = c(X = 0, W1 = 1, U = 1, W2 = 0.5, Y = 0))
# Plot
p5 <- ggdag(dag4) + theme_dag()
p5
```

The causal effect of X &rarr; Y can be obtained by blocking all the backdoor paths that do not involve descendants of X

. . .

- Randomization: (when done successfully) eliminates all paths entering X
- Conditioning (holding constant)

# Post-Treatment Bias

Adjusting/"controlling" for covariates imply a causal interpretation

> Please do not simply adjust for a variable without thinking about it (especially variables that may be impacted by the treatment)

## Data for Framing Experiment

- `cong_mesg`: binary variable indicating whether or not the participant agreed to send a letter about immigration policy to his or her member of Congress

- `emo`: post-test anxiety about increased immigration (0-9)

- `tone`: framing of news story (0 = positive, 1 = negative)

#| results: hide
library(brms)

# Mediation

Mediation is a causal analysis, by definition

## Mediation

```{r}
dag5 <- dagitty("dag{
  T -> C; T -> E; E -> C
}")
coordinates(dag5) <- list(x = c(T = 0, E = 1, C = 2),
                          y = c(T = 0, E = 1, C = 0))
# Plot
p6 <- ggdag(dag5) + theme_dag()
p6
```

In the DAG, E is a post-treatment variable potentially influenced by T

- E is a potential **mediator**

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
A mediator is very different from a confounder
:::

```{r}
#| include: false
m_med <- brm(
    # Two equations for two outcomes
    bf(cong_mesg ~ tone + emo) +
        bf(emo ~ tone) +
        set_rescor(FALSE),
    # A list of two family arguments for two outcomes
    family = list(bernoulli("logit"), gaussian("identity")),
    data = framing,
    prior = prior(normal(0, 2), class = "b", resp = "emo") +
        prior(student_t(4, 0, 5), class = "sigma", resp = "emo") +
        prior(student_t(4, 0, 2.5), class = "b", resp = "congmesg"),
    seed = 1338,
    file = "08b_m_med"
)
```

## Direct Effect

Causal effect when holding mediator at a specific level (e.g., T &rarr; C when E = 5)

*Controlled direct effect*

```{r}
cond_df <- data.frame(tone = c(0, 1, 0, 1),
                      emo = c(0, 0, 9, 9))
cond_df |>
    bind_cols(
        fitted(m_med, newdata = cond_df)[ , , "congmesg"]
    ) |>
    knitr::kable()
```

## Natural Direct Effect

Comparing two potential outcomes: (a) Y(T = 1, M = M[0]) and (b) Y(T = 0, M = M[0])

E.g., What would the effect of negatively-framed story be *had it not elicited* negative emotions?

## Natural Indirect Effect

Change in $Y$ of the control group if their mediator level changes to what the treatment group *would have obtained*

i.e., Y(T = 0, M = M[1]) - Y(T = 0, M = M[0])

E.g., What would the effect of negatively-framed story be *had it only elicited* negative emotions, but did not affect anything else?

## Notes on Mediation

::: {.incremental}
- When the effects of T &rarr; M (usually called the a path) and M &rarr; Y (usually called the b path) are assumed linear, the indirect effect equals the product of the paths (ab)
    * When a and/or b are not linear, the indirect effect is not constant across different levels of T and M
    * Also the case when there is interaction between the treatment and the mediator
:::

## Assumptions of Mediation

::: {.incremental}
- No unmeasured treatment-outcome confounding
- No unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding
- No unmeasured treatment-mediator confounding
- The mediator-outcome path is not moderated by the treatment
:::

. . .

Note: randomization of the treatment only rules out confounding for T &rarr; M, but not for M &rarr; Y

## Sensitivity Analysis

Assign priors representing plausible magnitude of confounding (see notes for an example)

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: .618
dag6 <- dagitty("dag{
  T -> C; T -> E; E -> C; U -> E; U -> C

                          y = c(T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, U = 1))
# Plot
p7 <- ggdag(dag6) + theme_dag()

## Some Other Topics for Causal Inference

- Propensity score analysis
    * Estimate probability of being in the treatment for each participant based on other covariates
    * Balancing out pre-treatment covariates so that the comparison more resembles a randomized experiments

. . .

- Regression discontinuity
    * E.g., Assigning to treatment only when pre-test score is below a cutoff
    * Pre-test score becomes the only confounding variable to be adjusted for

## Remarks

- Causal inference requires **causal assumptions**
    * You need a DAG

. . .

- Blindly adjusting for covariates does not give better results
    * post-treatment bias, collider bias, etc

. . .

- Think carefully about what causal quantity is of interest
    * E.g., direct, indirect, total

. . .

- Causal inferences are possible with both experimental and non-experimental data
