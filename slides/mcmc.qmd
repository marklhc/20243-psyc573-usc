## MC With One Unknown

`rbeta()`, `rnorm()`, `rbinom()`: generate values that imitate *independent samples* from known distributions

- use *pseudorandom* numbers

E.g., `rbeta(n, shape1 = 15, shape2 = 10)`{.r}

```{r}
#| fig-width: 4.5
#| fig-asp: 0.618
#| fig-align: center
# Set the `seed` (initial point) for pseudo-random number generation algorithm
set.seed(2)
num_draws <- c(10, 100, 1000, 10000)
beta_draws <- data.frame(
    th = rbeta(sum(num_draws), shape1 = 15, shape2 = 10),
    sam = rep(paste(num_draws, "samples"), num_draws)
)
ggplot(beta_draws, aes(x = th)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density))) +

# Markov Chain Monte Carlo

## MCMC

Main problem in Bayesian: no way to draw independent samples from posterior
$$
P(\theta \mid y) = \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-(\theta - 1 / 2)^2} 
                                     \theta^y (1 - \theta)^{n - y}}
                       {\int_0^1 \mathrm{e}^{-(\theta^* - 1 / 2)^2} 
                        {\theta^*}^y (1 - {\theta^*})^{n - y} d\theta^*}
$$

MCMC: draw *dependent (correlated)* samples without evaluating the integral in the denominator

Some commonly used algorithms

* The Metropolis algorithm (also called *random-walk* Metropolis)

* Gibbs sampling (in BUGS, JAGS)

* Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (and No-U-Turn sampler; in STAN)

You have a task: tour all regions in LA county, and the time your spend on each region should be proportional to its popularity 

However, you don't know which region is the most popular

Each day, you will decide whether to stay in the current region or move to a neighboring region

You have a tour guide that tells you whether region A is more or less popular than region B and by how much

> How would you proceed?

## Using the Metropolis Algorithm

1. On each day, randomly select a new region
2. If the *proposed* region is *more popular* than the current one, definitely go to the new region
3. If the *proposed* region is *less popular* than the current one, go to the new region with  
    $P(\text{accept the new region}) = \frac{\text{proposed region popularity}}{\text{current region popularity}}$
    - E.g., by spinning a wheel

In the long run, distribution of time spent in each region = distribution of popularity of each region

## Analytic Posterior

Beta(1.5, 2) prior $\to$ Beta(87.5, 254) posterior

1,000 independent draws from the posterior:

```{r}
num_draws <- 1000
set.seed(1610)
rbeta_draws <- rbeta(num_draws, shape1 = 87.5, shape2 = 254)
ggplot(
    data.frame(th = rbeta_draws),
    aes(x = th)
) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.0064) +
    stat_function(
        fun = dbeta,
        args = list(shape1 = 87.5, shape2 = 254),
        col = "red"
    ) +
    labs(x = expression(theta))
```

## With the Metropolis Algorithm

Proposal density: $N(0, 0.1)$; Starting value: $\theta^{(1)} = 0.1$

```{r sample-metropolis}
prior_a <- 1.5
prior_b <- 2
num_yes <- 86
num_obs <- 86 + 252
# Define a function to compute values proportional to p(y | th) * p(th)
prior_times_lik <- function(th) {
    # Return 0 if th is out of range
    if (th < 0 || th > 1) return(0)
    pth <- dbeta(th, shape1 = prior_a, shape2 = prior_b)
    py_given_th <- th ^ num_yes * (1 - th) ^ (num_obs - num_yes)
    pth * py_given_th
}
# Define a function for generating data from the proposal distribution
generate_proposal <- function(th, sd = 0.1) {
    rnorm(1, mean = th, sd = sd)
}
# Initialize the Metropolis algorithm
set.seed(2037)  # set the seed for reproducibility
num_draws <- 1000
num_warmup <- num_draws / 2
th_all_draws <- rep(NA, num_draws)
# Step 1: starting value
th_all_draws[1] <- 0.1
# counter for tracking acceptance rate
num_accepted <- 0
for (s in seq_len(num_draws - 1)) {
    current_th <- th_all_draws[s]
    # Step 2: Generate proposal
    proposed_th <- generate_proposal(current_th)
    # Step 3: Compute acceptance probability
    prob_accept <- min(
        1,
        prior_times_lik(proposed_th) /
            prior_times_lik(current_th)
    )
    # Steps 4 & 5: etermine whether to make the jump
    if (runif(1) < prob_accept) {
        th_all_draws[s + 1] <- proposed_th
        if (s + 1 >= num_warmup) {
            num_accepted <- num_accepted + 1
        }
    } else {
        th_all_draws[s + 1] <- current_th
    }
}
```

```{r performance-metropolis}
ggplot(
    data.frame(th = th_all_draws),
    aes(x = th)
) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.0064) +
    stat_function(
        fun = dbeta,
        args = list(shape1 = 87.5, shape2 = 254),
        col = "red"
    ) +
    labs(x = expression(theta))
```

With enough *iterations*, the Metropolis will simulate samples from the target distribution

It is *less efficient* than `rbeta()`{.r} because the draws are *dependent*

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}

## Pros

- does not require solving the integral
- can use non-conjugate priors
- easy to implement
:::

::: {.callout-warning}

## Cons
- not efficient; not scalable in complex models
- require tuning the proposal SD; 

:::

# MCMC Diagnostics

## Markov Chain

Markov chain: a sequence of iterations, $\{\theta^{(1)}, \theta^{(2)}, \ldots, \theta^{(S)}\}$

- the "state" $\theta^{(s)}$ depends on $\theta^{(s - 1)}$
    * where to travel next depends on where the current region is

Based on *ergodic* theorems, a well-behaved chain will reach a *stationary distribution*

- after which, every draw is a sample from the stationary distribution

::: {.content-hidden unless-profile="class"}

## Exercise

1. Try using different proposal SD: 0.02, 0.1, 0.3, 1
2. For each, draw 1,000 samples
3. Does the sample distribution look like the target posterior?
4. What is the relationship between proposal SD, acceptance rate, and autocorrelation?
5. Which proposal SD seems to give the best effective sample size?

:::

## Warm-up

It takes a few to a few hundred thousand iterations for the chain to get to the stationary distribution

Therefore, a common practice is to discard the first $S_\text{warm-up}$ (e.g., first half of the) iterations

- Also called *burn-in*

```{r}
library(bayesplot)
library(posterior)
th_draws_array <- draws_array(
    theta = th_all_draws
)
mcmc_trace(th_draws_array, n_warmup = num_warmup)
```

## When Can We Use MCMC Draws to Approximate the Posterior?

1. The draws need to be *representative* of the posterior
2. The draws contain sufficient information to *accurately* describe the posterior

. . .

### Tools

- Trace plots/Rank histograms
- $\hat R$
- Effective sample size (ESS)

## Representativeness

The chain does not get stuck

*Mixing*: multiple chains cross each other

```{r}
#| include: false
# Initialize the Metropolis algorithm

num_chains <- 2
num_draws <- 500

for (s in seq_len(num_draws - 1)) {
    for (j in seq_len(num_chains)) {

        # Generate proposal
        proposed_th <- generate_proposal(current_th, sd = 0.005)
        # Compute acceptance probability
        prob_accept <- min(
            1,
            prior_times_lik(proposed_th) /
                prior_times_lik(current_th)
        )

            if (s + 1 >= num_warmup) {
                num_accepted[j] <- num_accepted[j] + 1
            }
        } else {
            th_all_draws[s + 1, j] <- current_th
        }
    }
}
# Save the draws after warm-up
th_draws <- th_all_draws[-(1:num_warmup), ]
```

            }
        } else {
            th_all_draws[s + 1, j] <- current_th
        }
    }
}
# Save the draws after warm-up
th_draws <- th_all_draws[-(1:num_warmup), ]
```

```{r trace-good}
# Convert to `draws_array` object to use the following functions
th_draws_array <- draws_array(
    theta = th_draws,
    .nchains = num_chains
)
rhat2 <- posterior::rhat(th_draws_array)
ess2 <- posterior::ess_basic(th_draws_array)
# Trace plot
p2 <- mcmc_trace(th_draws_array)
# Rank hist
rh2 <- mcmc_rank_hist(th_draws_array)
```

```{r}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```

## Representativeness (cont'd)

For more robust diagnostics [@vehtari2021]

- The rank histograms should look like uniform distributions

```{r}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(rh1, rh2)
```

## Representativeness (cont'd)

$$
\hat{R} = \frac{\text{Between-chain variance} + \text{within-chain variance}}
                 {\text{within-chain variance}}
$$

- aka: *Gelman-Rubin statistic*, the *potential scale reduction factor*

. . .

When the chains converge, each should be exploring the same stationary distribution

- No between-chain differences $\Rightarrow$ $\hat{R} \to 1$
- @vehtari2021 recommended $\hat{R} < 1.01$ for convergence

---

In the previous examples, 

- $\hat R$ = `r rhat1` for the poor mixing graph
- $\hat R$ = `r rhat2` for the good mixing graph

## Effective Sample Size (ESS)

MCMC draws are dependent, so they contain less information for the target posterior distribution

> What is the equivalent number of draws if the draws were independent?

- E.g., ESS = `r ess2` for the good mixing example
    * Need ~`r 1000 * 500 / ess2` draws to get equal amount of information as 1,000 independent samples

## Heuristics for ESS

- ESS (bulk and tail) > 400 to interpret $\hat R$ [@vehtari2021]
- ESS > 1000 for stable summary of the posterior
    * Kruschke (2015) recommended 10,000

## Sample Convergence Paragraph

```{r sample-metropolis-10000, include = FALSE}
# Initialize the Metropolis algorithm
set.seed(2037)  # set the seed for reproducibility
num_chains <- 2
num_draws <- 10000

            th_all_draws[s + 1, j] <- proposed_th
            if (s + 1 >= num_warmup) {
                num_accepted[j] <- num_accepted[j] + 1
            }
        } else {
            th_all_draws[s + 1, j] <- current_th
        }
    }
}
# Save the draws after warm-up
th_draws <- th_all_draws[-(1:num_warmup), ]
# Convert to `draws_array` object to use the following functions
th_draws_array <- draws_array(
    theta = th_draws,
    .nchains = num_chains
)
summ_th <- summarise_draws(th_draws_array)
```

> We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), specifically a Metropolis algorithm implemented in R, to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We used two chains, each with 10,000 draws. The first 5,000 draws in each chain were discarded as warm-ups. Trace plots of the posterior samples (Figure X) showed good mixing, and $\hat R$ statistics (Vehtari et al., 2021) were < 1.01 for all model parameters, indicating good convergence for the MCMC chains. The effective sample sizes > `r ess_basic(th_draws_array)` for all model parameters, so the MCMC draws are sufficient for summarizing the posterior distributions.

## Sample Results

> The model estimated that `r summ_th$mean * 100`% (posterior SD = `r summ_th$sd * 100`%, 90% CI [`r summ_th$q5 * 100`%, `r summ_th$q95 * 100`%]) of first-generation immigrants took the metro in the year 2019.

## Things to Remember
    
- MCMC draws dependent/correlated samples to approximate a posterior distribution
    * ESS < $S$
- It needs warm-up iterations to reach a stationary distribution
- Check for representativenes
    * Trace/Rank plot and $\hat{R}$
- Need large ESS to describe the posterior accurately
